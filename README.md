# Todo console app

My second app with Node.js. It's a todo list that works in your command prompt and generates a .json file in the db folder that works as a database. This app uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors">Colors.js</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer">Inquirer</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid">uuid</a>.
